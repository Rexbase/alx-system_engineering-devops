# Load Balancer Project

## Overview

This project implements a load balancer, a crucial component in distributing incoming network traffic across multiple servers. The goal is to ensure optimal resource utilization, minimize response time, and prevent overload on individual servers.

## Features

- **Load Balancing Algorithms:** Implement various load balancing algorithms such as Round Robin, Least Connections, and IP Hash.
  
- **Scalability:** Easily scale the infrastructure by adding or removing servers dynamically.

- **Health Checks:** Perform health checks on servers to route traffic only to healthy instances.

- **Monitoring and Logging:** Provide monitoring and logging capabilities for better insights into system behavior.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Any additional dependencies or requirements

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/load-balancer.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd load-balancer

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

1. Configure the load balancer settings in the `config.yaml` file.

2. Run the load balancer:

```bash
python load_balancer.py
```

3. Access your application through the load balancer's IP or domain.

## Configuration

Adjust the `config.yaml` file to customize load balancing strategies, server settings, and other parameters.
