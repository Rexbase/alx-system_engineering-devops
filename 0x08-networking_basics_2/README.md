## Introduction to Networking

In this section, you will get an overview of what computer networking is, its importance, and the basic components of a network.

- What Is Networking?
- Types of Networks (LAN, WAN, MAN)
- Importance of Networking
- Network Components: Routers, Switches, Hubs, etc.

## The OSI Model

Understand the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model, which defines how different networking protocols communicate in layers.

- Seven Layers of the OSI Model
- Role of Each OSI Layer
- Protocols Associated with Each Layer

## IP Addresses and Subnetting

Learn about IP addresses, both IPv4 and IPv6, and how subnetting is used to manage IP address allocation.

- IPv4 vs. IPv6
- Format of IP Addresses
- Private vs. Public IP Addresses
- Subnet Masks and CIDR Notation

## TCP and UDP

Explore the two primary transport layer protocols, TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).

- TCP vs. UDP: Differences and Use Cases
- TCP Three-Way Handshake
- UDP Datagram Structure
- Reliable vs. Unreliable Data Transmission

## DNS and DHCP

Discover the Domain Name System (DNS) and Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) for hostname resolution and IP address assignment.

- How DNS Works: Resolving Domain Names
- Role of DHCP in IP Address Assignment
- DNS Records: A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, PTR, etc.

## Network Topologies

Learn about different network topologies, including star, bus, ring, and mesh, and their advantages and disadvantages.

- Star Topology
- Bus Topology
- Ring Topology
- Mesh Topology

## Common Network Protocols

Explore some of the most commonly used network protocols, including HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SSH, and more.

- HTTP and HTTPS: Web Browsing
- FTP: File Transfer
- SSH: Secure Shell
- SMTP and POP3: Email Communication

## Security in Networking

Understand the importance of network security and common security measures to protect networks from threats.

- Network Security Challenges
- Firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)
- Encryption and VPNs
- Security Best Practices

## Networking Tools and Utilities

Discover essential networking tools and utilities used for network diagnostics and troubleshooting.

- Ping and Traceroute
- Wireshark: Network Packet Analyzer
- Netstat: Network Statistics
- Nmap: Network Mapper
