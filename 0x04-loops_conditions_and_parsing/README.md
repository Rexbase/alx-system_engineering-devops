# 0x04. Loops, Conditions, and Parsing

## Overview

In this project, we delve into the world of loops, conditions, and parsing in programming. These concepts are fundamental to writing efficient and functional code. Whether you are a beginner looking to grasp the basics or an experienced developer aiming to enhance your skills, this project has something for everyone.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will have a solid understanding of the following concepts:

- **Conditional Statements:** Learn how to control the flow of your code based on conditions, using if statements, else statements, and elif statements.

- **Loops:** Understand the power of loops in automating repetitive tasks. We'll explore both while loops and for loops.

- **Parsing:** Dive into the world of parsing, where you'll learn how to extract valuable information from text or data.

## Project Files

This project includes the following files and directories:

- `0-positive_or_negative.py`: A Python script that prints whether a randomly generated number is positive, negative, or zero.

- `1-last_digit.py`: A Python script that prints the last digit of a randomly generated number.

- `2-print_alphabet.py`: A Python script that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase.

- `3-print_alphabt.py`: A Python script that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, except for the letters 'q' and 'e'.

- `4-print_hexa.py`: A Python script that prints all hexadecimal digits (0-9, a-f) in order.

- `5-print_comb2.py`: A Python script that prints all possible combinations of two digits, ranging from 00 to 99.

- `6-print_comb3.py`: A Python script that prints all possible combinations of two different digits, ranging from 01 to 98.

- `7-islower.py`: A Python script that checks if a character is a lowercase letter.

- `8-uppercase.py`: A Python script that converts all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.

- `9-print_last_digit.py`: A Python script that prints the last digit of a number without using conditionals or loops.

- `10-add.py`: A Python script that adds two integers and returns the result.

- `11-pow.py`: A Python script that computes `a` to the power of `b` and returns the result.

- `12-fizzbuzz.py`: A Python script that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of 3, it prints "Fizz" instead of the number; for multiples of 5, it prints "Buzz"; and for multiples of both 3 and 5, it prints "FizzBuzz".

- `13-insert_number.c`: A C function that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list.

- `100-print_tebahpla.py`: A Python script that prints the ASCII alphabet in reverse order, alternating between uppercase and lowercase.

- `101-remove_char_at.py`: A Python function that removes a character at a specific position in a string.

- `102-magic_calculation.py`: A Python function that replicates the behavior of a given bytecode.

## Getting Started

To run the Python scripts, you will need to have Python installed on your system. You can execute the scripts from your terminal using the following command:

```bash
python <script_name>.py
```

For the C program, you will need to compile it first. You can do so using a C compiler like `gcc`:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic 13-insert_number.c -o insert_number
```

Then, you can run the compiled program:

```bash
./insert_number
```

## Usage

Feel free to explore the code and experiment with different inputs. These scripts and functions serve as valuable learning tools for understanding loops, conditions, and parsing in programming.
